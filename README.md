# Ortus

*Ortus* (Latin: "rising, origin, birth") — the point from which something springs into being.

An opinionated [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) template for scaffolding new projects with AI-assisted development workflows.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Copier
uv tool install copier
# or: pipx install copier
```

### Step 1: Generate Your Project

```bash
copier copy gh:who/ortus ./my-project
cd my-project
```

The generator will:
- Ask you about your project (name, language, framework, etc.)
- Scaffold the project structure
- Initialize git and beads automatically

You now have a blank slate ready for development.

### Step 2: Kickstart Your Feature

Run `./ortus/idea.sh` to start. You'll choose between two paths:

**Path A: You have a PRD**
```bash
./ortus/idea.sh
# Choose [1] "Yes, I have a PRD"
# Provide the path to your PRD file
```
Your PRD gets decomposed into an epic with implementation tasks, ready for Ralph.

**Path B: You have an idea**
```bash
./ortus/idea.sh "A CLI tool that converts markdown to PDF with custom themes"
# Or run ./ortus/idea.sh and choose [2] "Nope, just an idea"
```

Claude will:
1. Expand your idea into a feature description
2. Run an interactive interview to clarify requirements
3. Generate a PRD document at `prd/PRD-[project-name].md`
4. Create implementation tasks from the approved PRD

### Step 3: Run Ralph

Then start the task implementation loop:

```bash
# Run until all tasks complete
./ortus/ralph.sh

# Complete exactly 1 task then exit
./ortus/ralph.sh --tasks 1

# Run in background
./ortus/ralph.sh &
```

Ralph implements tasks:
1. Find the next ready task (`bd ready`)
2. Claim and implement it
3. Run verification (tests, linting)
4. Commit and push changes
5. Mark the task complete

## Work Execution Policy

> **All implementation work MUST go through Ralph loops.**

- Direct coding is not allowed in interactive Claude sessions
- Create beads issues instead of implementing directly
- Ralph loops execute the actual work
- Research and planning are allowed without Ralph
