Sleep and repeat\ndone\n```\n\n### Idea Intake\n- Run `bd ready --assignee prd-pipeline` to find ideas ready for processing\n- Filter to only process ideas (not tasks/epics)\n- Track which ideas are already being processed (avoid duplicate processing)\n\n### Pipeline States\nHandle ideas in different stages:\n\n1. **New idea (no Q\u0026A subtasks)**: \n   - Generate Q\u0026A subtasks (use task copier-project-archetype-65m logic)\n   - Mark as \"in Q\u0026A phase\"\n\n2. **In Q\u0026A phase (has open subtasks)**:\n   - Check if all Q\u0026A subtasks are closed\n   - If not, skip (waiting for human)\n   - Could log status for visibility\n\n3. **Q\u0026A complete (all subtasks closed)**:\n   - Collect answers (use task copier-project-archetype-5ic logic)\n   - Generate PRD and explode tasks (use task copier-project-archetype-8rx logic)\n   - Close idea\n\n### State Tracking\n- Use bead labels or a local state file to track pipeline phase\n- Possible labels: `prd:qa-pending`, `prd:qa-complete`, `prd:generating`\n- Or store state in `.prd-pipeline-state.json`\n\n### Error Handling\n- Catch and log errors for each idea\n- Don't let one failed idea block others\n- Consider retry logic with backoff\n\n### Logging\n- Log pipeline activity for debugging\n- Show which ideas are being processed\n- Report on Q\u0026A waiting status\n\n## Configuration\n- POLL_INTERVAL: How often to check for new ideas (default: 60s)\n- DRY_RUN: Option to simulate without making changes\n\n## File Location\n- Create at: `scripts/prd-pipeline.sh`\n- Make executable\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Continuously polls for prd-pipeline assigned ideas\n- [ ] Correctly identifies idea pipeline stage\n- [ ] Orchestrates Q\u0026A generation for new ideas\n- [ ] Detects Q\u0026A completion and triggers PRD generation\n- [ ] Handles errors gracefully\n- [ ] Includes logging for observability\n- [ ] Can be run as background process","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"ralph","owner":"githubwho@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T09:47:55.3266148-08:00","created_by":"who","updated_at":"2026-01-18T10:31:41.413961995-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-18T10:05:20.086291076-08:00","close_reason":"Done: Created prd-pipeline.sh orchestration script with full async workflow","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ortus-swo","depends_on_id":"ortus-8rx","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-18T09:48:18.556551508-08:00","created_by":"who"}]}
