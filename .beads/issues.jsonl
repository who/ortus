Claude Code opens\n4. Claude sits at prompt waiting for user input\n5. No AskUserQuestion is triggered\n\n## Expected Behavior\n1. interview.sh finds feature\n2. Claude Code opens with context\n3.

This maps well to ortus's workflow where the codebase is the primary context.\n\nSee: analysis/RLM-integration-analysis.md for full technical analysis.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **3-5x speedup** for task decomposition in interview.sh\n- **2-3x speedup** for batched task implementation in ralph.sh\n- **Automatic dependency analysis** (removes human bottleneck)\n- **Higher quality PRDs** with codebase awareness\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\nOpt-in enhancement with feature flag, starting with interview.sh as proof-of-concept.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Task completion time reduced from ~5 min to ~2 min per task\n- PRD revision cycles reduced from 2-3 to 1 average\n- Dependency accuracy improved from ~70% to ~90%\n\n## References\n\n- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601\n- Implementation: https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"githubwho@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T19:00:41.069508544-08:00","created_by":"who","updated_at":"2026-01-20T06:42:07.584264639-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T06:42:07.584264639-08:00","close_reason":"All 13 implementation tasks completed.

Create tests/ folder structure\n```\ntests/\n├── test-ralph.sh          # Main test runner\n└── fixtures/\n    └── calculator-tasks.md  # Task definitions file\n```\n\n### 2. Create task definition file (tests/fixtures/calculator-tasks.md)\n\nDefine 3 simple tasks with clear descriptions and acceptance criteria. Example:\n\n```markdown\n# Task 1: Create greeting module\nCreate a file src/greeting.py with a greet() function that returns 'Hello, World!'\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- File src/greeting.py exists\n- Function greet() is defined\n- greet() returns the string 'Hello, World!'\n\n---\n\n# Task 2: Add personalized greeting\nAdd a greet_person(name) function to src/greeting.py that returns 'Hello, {name}!'\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Function greet_person(name) is defined in src/greeting.py\n- greet_person('Alice') returns 'Hello, Alice!'\n\n---\n\n# Task 3: Add farewell function\nAdd a farewell(name) function to src/greeting.py that returns 'Goodbye, {name}!'\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Function farewell(name) is defined in src/greeting.py\n- farewell('Bob') returns 'Goodbye, Bob!'\n```\n\n### 3. Update test-ralph.sh\n\n- Move to tests/test-ralph.sh\n- Read task definitions from tests/fixtures/calculator-tasks.md\n- Create beads tasks in the tmp test project's beads context\n- Parse the markdown file to extract title, description, and acceptance criteria for each task\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] tests/ folder exists with test-ralph.sh\n- [ ] tests/fixtures/calculator-tasks.md defines 3 simple tasks\n- [ ] Tasks have clear descriptions and acceptance criteria\n- [ ] test-ralph.sh reads from the fixture file\n- [ ] Tasks are created in the tmp project's beads context (not ortus's)\n- [ ] Old test-ralph.sh removed from root","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"ralph","owner":"githubwho@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T08:17:19.97454005-08:00","created_by":"who","updated_at":"2026-01-19T08:20:49.773501195-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-19T08:20:49.773501195-08:00","close_reason":"Refactored test-ralph.sh into tests/ folder with external fixture file for task definitions","comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"ortus-yfp","author":"who","text":"Starting work.
