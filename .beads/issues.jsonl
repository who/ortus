The tool results contain beads comments that mention the word 'BLOCKED' (e.g., 'clarified BLOCKED should only be used...'), so this matches before the EMPTY check on line 42.\n\n**Order in ralph.sh**:\n```\nLine 40: elif [[ \"$result\" == *\"\u003cpromise\u003eBLOCKED\u003c/promise\u003e\"* ]] || [[ \"$result\" == *\"BLOCKED\"* ]]\nLine 42: elif [[ \"$result\" == *\"\u003cpromise\u003eEMPTY\u003c/promise\u003e\"* ]] || [[ \"$result\" == *\"EMPTY\"* ]]\n```\n\n**Fix options**:\n1. Move EMPTY check before BLOCKED check, OR\n2. Remove the loose fallback patterns (`*BLOCKED*`, `*COMPLETE*`, `*EMPTY*`) and only match the full `\u003cpromise\u003eX\u003c/promise\u003e` tags, OR\n3.
