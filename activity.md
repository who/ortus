## 2026-01-19T12:30:00-08:00 - Fix test-lisa.sh not working (complete)

**Task**: ortus-157 - Fix test-lisa.sh not working
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Fixed jq parsing bug on line 243 of template/lisa.sh
- Changed `.description` to `.[0].description` to match `bd show --json` output format (which returns an array)
- Previous session fixed label check from "prd:approved" to "approved" on line 773

**Root cause**: Two issues combined: 1) Label mismatch (fixed previously), 2) jq parsing assumed object but bd show --json returns array

**Verification**: `./tests/test-lisa.sh --dry-run` passes, bash syntax check passes, both `.[0].description` usages now consistent.

## 2026-01-19T13:00:00-08:00 - Create and validate test-lisa.sh test script

**Task**: ortus-a1r - Create and validate test-lisa.sh test script
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Verified tests/test-lisa.sh already existed with complete implementation
- Test generates project from ortus template in /tmp
- Test creates an idea bead assigned to lisa
- Test runs lisa.sh and validates full pipeline (interview questions, PRD generation, task creation)
- Verified dry-run mode works correctly

**Verification**: `./tests/test-lisa.sh --dry-run` passes - creates test project, creates idea bead, displays manual testing instructions.

## 2026-01-19T12:30:00-08:00 - Fix PrerequisiteChecker extension timing

**Task**: ortus-kdb - PrerequisiteChecker extension not loading during template generation
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Extension WAS loading, but output appeared at the end due to stdout buffering
- Moved check execution from `hook()` to `__init__()` to run when Jinja environment is created
- Added `flush=True` to all print statements to prevent output buffering
- Checks now appear before the "Welcome" message, not after "Project created"

**Root cause**: The `ContextHook.hook()` method runs during Jinja template rendering which happens late in the Copier workflow. Python's stdout buffering delayed the output further. By running checks in `__init__` with explicit flushing, output appears immediately when the Jinja environment is created.

**Verification**: Template generation shows prerequisite checks at the start with ✓/✗ markers for all 6 tools, appearing before the welcome message.

## 2026-01-19T11:10:00-08:00 - Remove check-prerequisites.sh from template folder

**Task**: ortus-ccg - Remove check-prerequisites.sh from template folder
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Deleted `template/check-prerequisites.sh` (vestigial - prereq checking now handled by Python extension)
- Removed `check-prerequisites.sh` from `_exclude` list in copier.yaml (no longer needed)

**Note**: During verification, discovered that the PrerequisiteChecker extension (extensions/prerequisites.py) is not being loaded during template generation. This is a pre-existing issue - filed as ortus-kdb.

**Verification**: Template generates successfully without copying check-prerequisites.sh. The _exclude entry was also redundant since the file no longer exists.

## 2026-01-19T11:45:00-08:00 - Implement lisa.sh approval and ralph handoff

**Task**: ortus-nxe - Implement lisa.sh approval and ralph handoff
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Added `generate_tasks_from_prd()` function that calls Claude to break PRD into implementation tasks
- Claude prompt asks for 3-10 atomic tasks with priorities and dependencies
- XML parsing extracts title, priority, depends_on, and description for each task
- Tasks created with `--assignee=ralph` using `bd create`
- Dependencies between tasks handled via task numbering system
- Implemented `handle_approved()` function as main entry point
- Detects 'approved' label and reads the PRD file (prd/PRD-<slug>.md)
- After task creation, removes 'prd:ready' and 'approved' labels
- Closes the idea with summary: "PRD complete. Created X tasks for ralph."
- Log output shows task creation details and provides `bd list --assignee ralph` command

**Verification**: Syntax check passes, help output correct. Full integration requires Claude API.

## 2026-01-19T10:45:00-08:00 - Implement lisa.sh interview completion detection

**Task**: ortus-om6 - Implement lisa.sh interview completion detection
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Implemented `handle_interviewing()` function to detect when all question beads are closed
- Uses `bd show --json` to get dependencies and checks their status
- Counts total dependencies vs open dependencies to determine completion
- Implemented `collect_answers()` function to extract answers from question bead comments
- Iterates through dependency IDs and collects comment text from each
- Formats answers as markdown with question titles as headers
- Answers stored in `logs/.lisa-answers-<idea-id>.tmp` for PRD generation phase
- Label transitions: removes `prd:interviewing`, adds `prd:ready`
- Handles edge cases: no questions (skips to ready), questions without answers (noted)

**Verification**: Syntax check passes, help output correct. Full integration requires Claude API.

## 2026-01-19T10:15:00-08:00 - Implement lisa.sh interview generation

**Task**: ortus-n75 - Implement lisa.sh interview generation
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Implemented `generate_interview_questions()` function that calls Claude to analyze ideas
- Claude generates 3-7 discovery questions in XML format for reliable parsing
- Questions cover: problem space, users, scope, success criteria, constraints
- Each question created as a bead assigned to 'human' with instructions on how to answer
- Blocking dependencies added: idea depends on all question beads
- `prd:interviewing` label added to idea after questions created
- Implemented `handle_new_idea()` state handler that orchestrates the flow
- Dual parsing approach: tries grep -P first, falls back to line-by-line sed parsing

**Verification**: Syntax check passes, help output correct. Full integration requires Claude API.

## 2026-01-19T09:25:00-08:00 - Create lisa.sh core loop structure

**Task**: ortus-oet - Create lisa.sh core loop structure
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Created `template/lisa.sh` with continuous polling loop (similar to ralph.sh)
- Configurable `--poll-interval` and `--idle-sleep` options
- Timestamped logging to `logs/lisa-<timestamp>.log`
- State routing based on labels: prd:interviewing, prd:ready, prd:approved
- Processes ideas assigned to 'lisa' via `bd ready --assignee lisa`
- Graceful handling of empty queue (sleeps and retries)
- Stubbed state handlers for: new ideas, interviewing, ready, approved
- Fixed epic dependency structure: removed subtask→epic dependencies that were blocking work

**Verification**: Syntax check passes, help output correct, brief loop test shows correct polling and logging behavior.

## 2026-01-19T08:30:00-08:00 - Merge ralph.sh and mega-ralph.sh with task limit option

**Task**: ortus-2wr - Epic: Merge ralph.sh and mega-ralph.sh with task limit option
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Merged `mega-ralph.sh` logic into `ralph.sh` - runs until queue empty by default (mega mode)
- Added `--tasks N` option to limit number of tasks to complete
- Added `--iterations N` option (replaces positional arg, with legacy support)
- Added `--idle-sleep N` option for configuring wait time when no work available
- Added `-h|--help` flag for showing usage information
- Removed `mega-ralph.sh` from both template/ and repository root
- Updated `copier.yaml` _tasks to remove mega-ralph.sh from chmod list
- Updated `README.md` with new usage examples and file structure

**Behavior**:
- `./ralph.sh` - Run until all tasks complete (default mega mode)
- `./ralph.sh --tasks 1` - Complete exactly 1 task then exit
- `./ralph.sh --tasks 5` - Complete up to 5 tasks then exit
- `./ralph.sh 20` - Legacy: 20 iterations per task (still works)

**Verification**: Tested template generation - ralph.sh is present and functional, mega-ralph.sh is absent, --help flag works correctly.

- Fixed header comment in `template/ralph.sh` to show `./tail.sh` without arguments
- Fixed runtime log output to show `./tail.sh` without arguments
- Added "(auto-follows all logs)" clarification to explain tail.sh behavior
- Human-readable option uses `./tail.sh` (no args needed, auto-watches logs/)
- Raw output option uses standard `tail -f` for a specific log file

**Verification**: Tested template generation - ralph.sh is copied to generated projects with correct instructions showing tail.sh requires no arguments.

---

## 2026-01-19T07:30:00-08:00 - Add tail.sh to template with terminal-agnostic colors

**Task**: ortus-510 - Add tail.sh to template with terminal-agnostic colors
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Created `template/tail.sh` with improved color handling using `tput` for terminal-aware colors

## 2026-01-18T16:41:12-08:00 - Git config defaults for copier wizard

**Task**: ortus-qom - Use git config for default author_name and author_email in copier wizard
**Status**: Completed
**Changes**:
- Created `extensions/context.py` with `GitConfigContext` class that retrieves git config values
- Updated `copier.yaml` to load `copier_templates_extensions.TemplateExtensionLoader` and custom extension
- Changed `author_name` default from "Developer" to `{{ git_user_name }}`
- Changed `author_email` default from "dev@example.com" to `{{ git_user_email }}`
- Extension gracefully falls back to "Developer" / "dev@example.com" when git config is not set

**Verification**: Tested template generation with and without git config values set. Template generates successfully in both cases with correct defaults.

**Note**: Users must have `copier-template-extensions` installed alongside copier for this feature to work (e.g., `uv tool install copier --with copier-template-extensions`).
