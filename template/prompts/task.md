# Task Workflow

Tasks are straightforward implementation work. Follow this workflow:

## Steps

1. **Read the task description** carefully to understand requirements
2. **Implement** the changes described
3. **Verify** using project quality checks (tests, linting)
4. **Close** the task with a brief summary

## Verification

Run appropriate quality checks for the project:
- Run tests if the task affects testable code
- Run linting if code was modified
- Run type checking if available

## Completion Criteria

A task is complete when:
- All described functionality is implemented
- Quality checks pass
- Code is committed with descriptive message
