# Ralph Wiggum Loop Prompt

Read @AGENTS.md for session rules and landing-the-plane protocol.
Read @activity.md for what was completed in the last iteration.

## Your Task

1. **Check Status**: Run `bd ready --assignee ralph` to see issues assigned to you with no blockers
2. **Select One Issue**: Pick the highest-priority issue from ready work
3. **Claim It**: Run `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
4. **Implement**: Make the code changes described in the issue
5. **Verify**: Run tests, linting, or other verification appropriate to your project
6. **Complete**: Run `bd close <id> --reason="<brief summary>"`
7. **Epic Ceremony**: Check if this completes an epic (see Epic Closure Ceremony below)
8. **Log Progress**: Update activity.md with dated entry
9. **Commit**: Stage and commit your changes with descriptive message
10. **Push**: Run `git pull --rebase && bd sync && git push` to preserve work

## Epic Closure Ceremony

After closing a task, **automatically** check if it was part of an epic that is now complete.

### 1. Detect Parent Epic

Immediately after running `bd close <task-id>`, run:

```bash
bd show <task-id> --json
```

Parse the JSON output to find the parent:
- Look for the `"depends_on"` array - these are issues this task depends on
- A parent epic/feature is an issue in `depends_on` with `issue_type` of "epic" or "feature"

If no parent epic/feature found, **skip the ceremony** and continue to activity.md logging.

### 2. Check Epic Completion Status

If a parent epic/feature was found:

```bash
bd show <parent-id> --json
```

Parse the JSON to check completion status:
- Look at the `"blocks"` array - these are child tasks that depend on the parent
- For each child issue ID, check if its status is "closed"
- If **ALL** children are closed, the epic is ready for ceremony
- If any children are still open, **skip the ceremony** - more work remains

### 3. Quality Gate Audit

Before closing the epic, verify all acceptance criteria are met.

#### 3a. Extract Acceptance Criteria

From the epic's `bd show <epic-id>` output, identify all acceptance criteria:
- Look for "Acceptance criteria" section in the description
- Also check for numbered requirements or bullet points describing expected behavior
- Each criterion should be testable/verifiable

#### 3b. Map Criteria to Completed Tasks

For each acceptance criterion, find the task that fulfills it:

```
| Criterion | Covered By | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| "Users can log in" | task-abc (auth implementation) | ✓ Verified |
| "Tests pass" | task-def (test suite) | ✓ Verified |
| "Docs updated" | ??? | ✗ MISSING |
```

To build this mapping:
1. Get the list of completed child tasks from `bd show <epic-id> --json` (check the `blocks` array)
2. For each closed child task, run `bd show <task-id>` to see what it implemented
3. Match task descriptions/titles to acceptance criteria

#### 3c. Create Tasks for Uncovered Criteria

If ANY acceptance criteria lack a completed task covering them:

```bash
# Example: Missing documentation for a feature
bd create --title="Add user documentation for login feature" --type=task --assignee=ralph --priority=2
bd dep add <new-task-id> <epic-id>

# Example: Missing test coverage
bd create --title="Add integration tests for auth flow" --type=task --assignee=ralph --priority=2
bd dep add <new-task-id> <epic-id>
```

**IMPORTANT**: If you create any new tasks, **stop here**. Do NOT proceed to the retrospective or close the epic. The new tasks must be completed first, and the ceremony will resume when the last task is closed.

#### 3d. Verify Test/Quality Evidence

For each criterion marked as covered:
1. Confirm the covering task included verification (tests ran, manual testing done)
2. Check that verification is documented (in task comments, activity.md, or commit messages)
3. If verification evidence is missing, add it now or create a task to add it

Only proceed to Step 4 if ALL criteria have verified coverage.

### 4. Write Retrospective

Add a retrospective entry to activity.md with:
- **Key decisions**: Important architectural or design choices made
- **Learnings**: What worked well, what was challenging
- **Follow-up**: Any tech debt or improvements deferred for later

### 5. Close Epic

Only after all criteria are verified:
```bash
bd close <epic-id> --reason="All acceptance criteria met: <brief summary of what was delivered>"
```

### When to Skip

Skip the ceremony if:
- The task has no parent epic
- The parent epic still has other open tasks

## Important Rules

- **One issue per iteration** - Do not work on multiple issues
- **No partial work** - Either complete the issue fully or don't start it
- **Update activity.md** - Record what you did with timestamp
- **Run quality checks** - Always run linting/tests before committing
- **Descriptive commits** - Include issue ID in commit message

## README Maintenance

After implementing a major feature:
1. Check if README.md exists
2. If not, create initial README with:
   - Project name and description
   - Installation/setup instructions
   - Usage documentation for implemented features
   - Basic examples
3. If README exists, update it with:
   - New feature documentation
   - Updated usage examples
   - Keep existing user-edited sections intact

## Completion Signal

When you have completed ONE issue successfully, output:

```
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

If you encounter a blocker that prevents completion, document it in activity.md and output:

```
<promise>BLOCKED</promise>
```

## Dependencies

Issues may have dependencies. Check with:
```bash
bd show <id>  # Shows dependencies in output
bd dep tree <id>  # Visual dependency tree
```

Only work on issues that have no unresolved blockers (i.e., issues shown by `bd ready --assignee ralph`).

## Project-Specific Notes

{%- if language == 'python' and package_manager == 'uv' %}
- Use `uv run` for all Python commands
{%- endif %}
{%- if framework == 'fastapi' %}
- API runs on port 8000 by default
{%- endif %}
